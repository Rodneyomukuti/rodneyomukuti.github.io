      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of wildlife researchers who utilize genomics and genetics to conserve species of conservation concern and the environment in Kenya. Our mission is to bridge the gap between conservation genetics/genomics, conservation biology, and conservation ecology, helping conservation managers make informed decisions based on cutting-edge research findings.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Our work spans various species and ecosystems, employing genetics as a critical tool for understanding and conserving biodiversity. We strive to address key conservation challenges through advanced genetic and genomic analyses, providing insights into species' taxonomy, diversity, evolution, and resilience.
      </p>

      <h3>Corals</h3>
      <p>
        We explore coral genetics to unravel their taxonomy, genetic diversity, and population structure. Our research also focuses on connectivity and resilience among coral populations, as well as their associations with symbionts and pathogenic microbes. These studies are essential for developing strategies to protect coral reefs in the face of environmental change.
      </p>

      <h3>Turtles</h3>
      <p>
        Our turtle research investigates genetic and environmental drivers of fibropapillomatosis, a disease threatening many populations. We also examine nesting patterns, nesting success, and conservation efforts targeting critical nesting beaches. These efforts aim to enhance the survival of these iconic marine species.
      </p>

      <h3>Killifish</h3>
      <p>
        We are working on identifying and cataloging killifish species in Kenya while assessing their genetic diversity. This foundational research is vital for understanding their ecological roles and potential conservation needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Billfish</h3>
      <p>
        Our studies on billfish focus on evolutionary genetics and divergence. By understanding their evolutionary history, we can provide valuable data to inform sustainable fisheries management and conservation policies.
      </p>

      <h3>Elephants</h3>
      <p>
        We conduct population genetics studies on elephants, exploring their evolution, genetic diversity, and population structure. These insights help address threats such as poaching and habitat loss, ensuring the long-term survival of these keystone species.
      </p>

      <h3>Monkeys</h3>
      <p>
        Our research on monkeys involves taxonomy, genetic diversity, and evolutionary studies. These efforts aim to better understand primate adaptation, behavior, and conservation needs in changing environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Forensics</h3>
      <p>
        In collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), we use genetic forensics to identify bush meat and combat wildlife trafficking. This initiative supports the conservation of endangered animals by providing scientific evidence to curb illegal wildlife trade.

      <h2>RECOURCE</h2>
      <p>
        RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION SUPPORT SOCIETY (RECOURCE) is a society with the following objectives:
      </p>
      <p>
        Promoting the use of scientific evidence by conservation organizations, fostering collaboration among researchers and practitioners, and providing technical support in study design, data analysis, bioinformatics, and scientific writing. We aim to mentor upcoming scientists and conservation practitioners through apprenticeship and offer affiliation for grant applications.
