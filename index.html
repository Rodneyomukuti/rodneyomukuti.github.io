      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of wildlife researchers who utilize genomics and genetics to conserve species of conservation concern and the environment in Kenya. Our mission is to bridge the gap between conservation genetics/genomics, conservation biology, and conservation ecology, helping conservation managers make informed decisions based on cutting-edge research findings.
      </p>

  <h2>Research Themes</h2>
  <p>
    Our research integrates genetics, microbiome studies, disease ecology, and ecological assessments to enhance conservation efforts across diverse species and ecosystems. Using cutting-edge genetic and genomic tools, we explore species diversity, population structure, evolutionary history, and conservation strategies.
  </p>

  <h3>Population Genetics</h3>
  <p>
    Population genetics is central to our work, helping us understand species diversity, connectivity, and evolutionary history. By analyzing genetic structure and variations, we provide insights into species resilience, adaptation, and conservation needs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Corals:</strong> We investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of corals, aiming to understand connectivity among reefs in the Western Indian Ocean.</li>
    <li><strong>Billfish:</strong> Our studies focus on evolutionary genetics and divergence, aiding sustainable fisheries management.</li>
    <li><strong>Elephants:</strong> We analyze genetic diversity and connectivity to combat poaching and habitat loss.</li>
    <li><strong>Monkeys:</strong> We explore taxonomy, diversity, and adaptation in response to environmental changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sea Cucumbers:</strong> We assess genetic diversity to manage fisheries and ensure sustainability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Microbiome</h3>
  <p>
    Microbial communities play an essential role in ecosystem health and species survival. We use metagenomics to investigate microbiomes associated with marine species, particularly corals.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coral Symbionts:</strong> Studying relationships between corals and microbial partners to understand resilience.</li>
    <li><strong>Coral-Associated Microbiome:</strong> Mapping microbial communities to identify beneficial and pathogenic microbes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Disease Ecology</h3>
  <p>
    We investigate the interactions between environmental factors, host genetics, and pathogens to understand disease dynamics in marine organisms.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Turtles - Fibropapillomatosis:</strong> Analyzing genetic and environmental drivers of this disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Screening of Pathogenic Microbes in Corals:</strong> Detecting coral disease-causing microbes to support conservation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ecology</h3>
  <p>
    We conduct ecological research to understand species behavior, habitat use, and conservation needs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Turtle Nesting Sites:</strong> Identifying and monitoring critical breeding grounds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Support (RECOURSE)</h3>
  <p>
    We employ innovative forensic techniques and model organisms to support conservation efforts and biodiversity research.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Forensics:</strong> Collaborating with KWS to combat wildlife trafficking using genetic analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Killifish:</strong> Cataloging species and assessing genetic diversity as model organisms for environmental studies.</li>
  </ul>
